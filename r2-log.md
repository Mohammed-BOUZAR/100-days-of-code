## Log

### R2D14 
Started a new project using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Set up the initial project structure and created a simple homepage.

### R2D15 
Today, I created the home page for the Quiz Generator project using Next.js + TailwindCSS + daisyUI.

### R2D16 
Built several reusable UI components for the Quiz Generator project.

### R2D17 
Today's work was about infrastructure and making the project production-ready. 💪🔥

### R2D18
Today was a cleanup day — and it felt great. The codebase is now much more organized, consistent, and future-proof. 🚀

### R2D19
Today I focused on the backend of the QuizGenerator project. I built the API endpoints for creating and managing quizzes.


### R2D20
It's great to have the full loop working - creation, sharing, participation, and scoring.

### R2D21
Today, I implemented user authentication using NextAuth and Prisma. Users can now sign up and sign in securely.

### R2D22
Today, I worked on the quiz-taking interface. Users can now take quizzes and see their scores at the end.

### R2D23
I love how the platform is becoming smoother and more powerful day by day. Each improvement makes it feel more like a real, production-ready tool!

### R2D24
I felt it wasn't a big progress but it was still important. These kinds of improvements make everything feel more solid.

### R2D25
The privacy system looks like it'll be tricky, but I'm actually looking forward to building it out.

### R2D26
Spent the day refining the quiz creation flow. Added more options for question types and improved the user experience.

### R2D27
The project seems to have suddenly opened up. I had been wanting to introduce AI into this project for a while, and starting the integration today has given the whole application more life. It's still in its early days, and there are still some shortcomings, but it's exciting to see where it will go.
